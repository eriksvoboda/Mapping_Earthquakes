# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to createan earthuake data map in relations to the tectonic plates' location. We selected any earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 to add to the map. We also added three base maps and three overlays. Below is an example of the final map with all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes viewed with the Dark Map.
